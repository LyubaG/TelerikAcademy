In computer programming, unit  is a software  method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are  to determine whether they are fit for use.[1] Intuitively, one can view a unit as the smallest  part of an application. In procedural programming, a unit could be an entire module, but it is more commonly an individual function or procedure. In object-oriented programming, a unit is often an entire interface, such as a class, but could be an individual method.[2] Unit  are short code fragments[3] created by programmers or occasionally by white box  during the development process. It is also known as component .[citation needed]

Ideally, each  case is independent from the others. Substitutes such as method stubs, mock objects,[4] fakes, and  harnesses can be used to assist  a module in isolation. Unit  are typically written and run by software developers to ensure that code meets its design and behaves as intended.
