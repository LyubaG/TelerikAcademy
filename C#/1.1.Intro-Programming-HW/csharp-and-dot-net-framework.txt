C# is a programming language, while the .NET Framework is an application framework library. .NET runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It includes a large class library known as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability across several programming languages, meaning that each language can use code written in other languages. The C# language object model corresponds to the .NET object model and you can do anything interesting in C# just by using .NET libraries, but you can also use other languages to write .NET applications. However, the .NET framework is more than that, as it also includes a virtual execution system called the common language runtime (CLR), essentially an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exceptions handling.
