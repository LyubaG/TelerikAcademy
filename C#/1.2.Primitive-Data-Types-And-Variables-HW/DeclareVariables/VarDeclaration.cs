//Problem 1. Declare Variables
//Declare five variables choosing for each of them the most appropriate of the types byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong to represent the following values: 52130, -115, 4825932, 97, -10000.
//Choose a large enough type for each number to ensure it will fit in it. Try to compile the code.
